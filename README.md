# Hello and welcome! 👋  

I'm **Christophe Donnat**, currently a student at *42 Perpignan*, France  
(*note: just "42", not "École 42"—they're serious about this* 😅).  


## What do I love most? 💡  
The thrill of solving:  
- 🔗 **Complex problems**  
- 🎲 **Unique challenges**  
- 🤯 **Occasionally mind-bending puzzles**  

There's nothing quite like untangling a twisted knot of logic and shouting, "It works!" 🙌  


## What am I doing here? 🧑‍💻  
This GitHub is where I share my coding adventures:  
- 🌱 Projects from my journey at **42**  
- 🧩 Algorithmic challenges, system programming, and more  
- 🚀 A growing portfolio as I explore the world of development  

Stay tuned—there’s more to come! 😉  


## A bit about me 🎮📚🎶  
When I’m not coding, I’m:  
- 📖 Geeking out over **sci-fi and fantasy literature** (ask me for recommendations!)  
- 🎮 Playing **video games** or **board games**  
- 🎸 Torturing a guitar (with mixed results)  
- 🎹 Failing spectacularly at piano  
- ✍️ Occasionally writing  
- 🚴‍♂️ Riding my bike (to feel virtuous, mostly)  





Hello and welcome!

Who am I?

I'm Christophe Donnat, currently a student at 42 Perpignan, France (note: it's just 42, not "École 42"—they're quite adamant about that).

I'm on a journey to become a developer, though I haven't settled on my ultimate path yet. Most likely, you'll find me diving into web development or enterprise software.

Before joining 42 and the world of programming, I had a previous career in the business sector, where I held leadership roles for quite a few years.

But my insatiable thirst for learning, combined with a love for science, logic, and all things tech, led me to take the leap and embark on this adventure at 42. It's been an exciting mix of intellectual challenges and human connections.

What do I love most? The thrill of solving increasingly complex, unique, and occasionally mind-bending puzzles. There's something deeply satisfying about untangling those knots—no matter how twisted they might be!

And when I’m not wrangling with code or machines, I’m your fairly standard geek. I’m into all things sci-fi, fantastic literature (ask me for some hidden gems!), gaming (video games and board games alike), listening to music, torturing a guitar in hopes of coaxing out a tune, torturing a piano and failing miserably, dabbling in writing, and occasionally hopping on a bike (for the sake of good conscience).


What is 42?

42 isn’t just a number or a nod to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy—it’s a revolutionary coding school (but don’t call it a school, they’re allergic to that word).

Forget traditional classrooms, teachers, or grades. At 42, you dive headfirst into a gamified, peer-to-peer learning experience where you’re both the student and the teacher. It’s as much about building code as it is about building resilience, collaboration, and a knack for figuring things out when there’s no one around to hand you the answers.

Think of it as a bootcamp for your brain, where caffeine and persistence are your best friends. Whether you’re debugging code or your life choices, 42 has a way of making sure you come out stronger.


What am I doing here?

This GitHub is a growing collection of my coding projects, most of which are tied to my journey at 42. From algorithmic challenges to system-level programming, you’ll find a variety of projects that showcase what I’ve been learning. As I continue to explore new areas and sharpen my skills, I’ll keep adding to the repository—so stay tuned for more!
