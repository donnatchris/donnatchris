### Hello and welcome!

I'm Christophe Donnat, currently a junior developer student at 42 Perpignan (France).
After a long career holding management positions in the commercial sector, I decided to dive into the world of code.

Why? Because I love technology. I believe in structure, logic, and algorithms.
I had a strong desire to learn again, to challenge and stimulate my cognitive abilities, while acquiring a creative profession where you actually build something.
From my previous career, I bring a strong sense of discipline, responsibility, and optimization — qualities that I now apply daily in the world of tech.

### What am I doing here?
This GitHub repository is where I store the projects I've completed at 42, usually accompanied by in-depth technical documentation or full tutorials.
This is where you can explore the skills I’ve developed along the way.
